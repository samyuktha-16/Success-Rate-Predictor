# Success Rate Predictor

## Overview
The Success Rate Predictor project uses machine learning techniques to evaluate and predict the success of startup ideas. It integrates TF-IDF for text feature extraction, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, and Gradient Boosting for classification to analyze textual data and provide actionable insights.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and preparation.
- **Model Development**: Utilizes TF-IDF, LDA, and Gradient Boosting for accurate prediction.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts key features and insights from textual data.
- **User Interaction**: Interface for inputting startup ideas and receiving success predictions.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Success-Rate-Predictor.git
cd Success-Rate-Predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run the predict_success.py script to train the model and make predictions:

```bash
python predict_success.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to input startup ideas and view predictions.
